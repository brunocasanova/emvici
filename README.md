findhit-emvici
=====================

emvici is an open-source javascript MVC framework for developers

Our goal is to make the web faster and reliable for all persons on earth (and maybe on other planets too).

So we packed a plugable framework with all the needs for developers:
* Easy to learn, as **jQuery**;
* Class based, you can extend capabilities of other classes on your class, AWESOME.
* Plugable, so you won't need to download jQuery, probably we will do a plugin for that!
* Social intended, we will handle logins, passwords and emails for you! :)
* Open-Source, it means that you can help others on your knowledge contributions!

npm install findhit/findhit-emvici -g
```

## Usage
